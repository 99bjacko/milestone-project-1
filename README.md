## Objective

In this project, I intend to create a fanpage for my favourite band, Muse. The goal of this website is to share my passion for the English rock band and potentially discover other people who share the same passion. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities in both HTML and CSS, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing, static webpage with clear navigation and intent.

## UX

### User Stories

- As a visitor to the website, I want the navigation between pages to be easy and intuitive.
- As a visitor to the website, I want the website to be responsive on a number of different devices.
- As a visitor to the website, I want to easily find information about the band.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is new to the band, I want the website to display relevant information about who Muse are.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is new to the band, I want the website to show the band's work.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is new to the band, I want the website to feature links to social media for the band.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is already a Muse fan, I want to know about why the author likes the band.
- As a Muse fan interested in finding other Muse fans, I want to be able to contact the creator of the website.

### Initial Concept

Beautifully displayed images and simple but eye-catching design are key for this website. The design should be kept free from distractions, not cluttered. Using a color scheme matching the band's black and white logo, this will allow images to stand out and the content will maintain contrast throughout. The website will be designed mobile-first, but will be responsive for other screen sizes.

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes. This step really allowed me to plan how I wanted things to look ahead of time, meaning I could focus on making my website look like the designs, instead of trying to make design decisions and program simultaneously.

- [Discography Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/discography_page_wireframe.png)
- [Gigs Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/gigs_page_wireframe.png)
- [Gallery Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/gallery_page_wireframe.png)
- [Contact Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/contact_page_wireframe.png)

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project was a simple decision to make. The Muse colour scheme centres around black with white accents, as seen in their logo. I believe that darker themes often look a lot cleaner too, so it made sense to stick with the theme of the band.

#### Typography

The typography for this project, in many ways is similar to the colour scheme. The typeface used, IBM Plex Sans, is the same one utilised by Muse on their own website, so it very much fits into the theme of a Muse fanpage.

## Features

### Common Features

- Navigation Bar

  - The design of the navigation bar is kept consistent across all of the pages of the website, following convention with a brand text on the left hand side and navigation links on the right.
  - The navigation bar includes links to Home, Discography, Gigs, The Gallery and Contact Me, in addition to having a link on the brand text, which follows convention as it links back to the homepage, a common shortcut that users are typically used to.
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive with smaller screens having a collapsed menu with a navigation toggler button and larger screens having a fully expended navigation bar.
  - The current page is shown as active in the navigation bar by appearing in solid white, with the other page links appearing in a grey colour, visibly indicating that they are inactive.

- Footer

  - The design of the footer is kept consistent across all pages of the website, following convention by having logo links to social media platforms.
  - The logo links provide an easy way of learning more information about Muse, allowing users to easily see what Muse have been posting.

- Page Heading

  - All pages besides the home page feature a simple page heading with appropriate vertical space between navigation bar and main page content
  - The headings follow the consistent style of the website and do not add unnecessary clutter.

### Features to Implement

Although I am mostly happy with my project, I believe that it can be improved in a few ways by implementing some additional features.

- Spotify Integration

  - The website could be made more engaging by encorporating some features linked to Spotify. Examples of this could be using embedded playlists for the albums on the Discography page or the album art shown on this page could link to the album on Spotify.
  - Another feature could be having the setlist of each concert on the gigs page as a Spotify playlist instead of just listing out the songs.
  - These features would allow for a more interactive experience, whilst also making it easier for new fans to listen to the band to see if they like the music.

- Last.fm Integration

  - Last.fm is a handy website where you can link streaming services such as Spotify and it tracks all of the songs that you listen to.
  - A new page on the website could be implemented, highlighting my favourite songs from the band, with screenshots or links showing my most listened to Muse songs since getting back into the band.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validator Service were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

When I initially checked my project, the validation service highlighted a few warnings.

- Ending link and hr tags with '/>'.
- Sections with no headings.

I changed this for each page and now every page passes the validation checks as seen here:

- [Index Page HTML](./docs/readme/index_html_validation.png) - Passed
- [Discography Page HTML](./docs/readme/discography_html_validation.png) - Passed
- [Gigs Page HTML](./docs/readme/gigs_html_validation.png) - Passed
- [The Gallery Page HTML](./docs/readme/gallery_html_validation.png) - Passed
- [Contact Me Page HTML](./docs/readme/contact_html_validation.png) - Passed
