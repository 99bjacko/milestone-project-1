## Objective

In this project, I intend to create a fanpage for my favourite band, Muse. The goal of this website is to share my passion for the English rock band and potentially discover other people who share the same passion. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities in both HTML and CSS, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing, static webpage with clear navigation and intent.

### Initial Concept

Beautifully displayed images and simple but eye-catching design are key for this website. The design should be kept free from distractions, not cluttered. Using a color scheme matching the band's black and white logo, this will allow images to stand out and the content will maintain contrast throughout. The website will be designed mobile-first, but will be responsive for other screen sizes.
