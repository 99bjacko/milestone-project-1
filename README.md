## Objective

In this project, I intend to create a fanpage for my favourite band, Muse. The goal of this website is to share my passion for the English rock band and potentially discover other people who share the same passion. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities in both HTML and CSS, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing, static webpage with clear navigation and intent.

## UX

### Initial Concept

Beautifully displayed images and simple but eye-catching design are key for this website. The design should be kept free from distractions, not cluttered. Using a color scheme matching the band's black and white logo, this will allow images to stand out and the content will maintain contrast throughout. The website will be designed mobile-first, but will be responsive for other screen sizes.

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes. This step really allowed me to plan how I wanted things to look ahead of time, meaning I could focus on making my website look like the designs, instead of trying to make design decisions and program simultaneously.

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project was a simple decision to make. The Muse colour scheme centres around black with white accents, as seen in their logo. I believe that darker themes often look a lot cleaner too, so it made sense to stick with the theme of the band.
