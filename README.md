## Objective

In this project, I intend to create a fanpage for my favourite band, Muse. The goal of this website is to share my passion for the English rock band and potentially discover other people who share the same passion. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities in both HTML and CSS, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing, static webpage with clear navigation and intent.

## UX

### User Stories

- As a visitor to the website, I want the navigation between pages to be easy and intuitive.
- As a visitor to the website, I want the website to be responsive on a number of different devices.
- As a visitor to the website, I want to easily find information about the band.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is new to the band, I want the website to display relevant information about who Muse are.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is new to the band, I want the website to show the band's work.
- As a visitor to the website and somebody who is new to the band, I want the website to feature links to social media for the band.

### Initial Concept

Beautifully displayed images and simple but eye-catching design are key for this website. The design should be kept free from distractions, not cluttered. Using a color scheme matching the band's black and white logo, this will allow images to stand out and the content will maintain contrast throughout. The website will be designed mobile-first, but will be responsive for other screen sizes.

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes. This step really allowed me to plan how I wanted things to look ahead of time, meaning I could focus on making my website look like the designs, instead of trying to make design decisions and program simultaneously.

- [Gigs Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/gigs_page_wireframe.png)
- [Gallery Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/gallery_page_wireframe.png)
- [Contact Page Wireframe](./docs/wireframes/contact_page_wireframe.png)

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project was a simple decision to make. The Muse colour scheme centres around black with white accents, as seen in their logo. I believe that darker themes often look a lot cleaner too, so it made sense to stick with the theme of the band.

#### Typography

The typography for this project, in many ways is similar to the colour scheme. The typeface used, IBM Plex Sans, is the same one utilised by Muse on their own website, so it very much fits into the theme of a Muse fanpage.

## Features

### Common Features

- Navigation Bar

  - The design of the navigation bar is kept consistent across all of the pages of the website, following convention with a brand text on the left hand side and navigation links on the right.
  - The navigation bar includes links to Home, Discography, Gigs, The Gallery and Contact Me, in addition to having a link on the brand text, which follows convention as it links back to the homepage, a common shortcut that users are typically used to.
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive with smaller screens having a collapsed menu with a navigation toggler button and larger screens having a fully expended navigation bar.
  - The current page is shown as active in the navigation bar by appearing in solid white, with the other page links appearing in a grey colour, visibly indicating that they are inactive.

- Footer

  - The design of the footer is kept consistent across all pages of the website, following convention by having logo links to social media platforms.
  - The logo links provide an easy way of learning more information about Muse, allowing users to easily see what Muse have been posting.
